Welcome to the Nixie Clock project repository! This project is a handmade clock that utilizes Nixie tubes to display the time in a vintage and aesthetically pleasing manner. The clock is powered by the Atmega32A microcontroller, offering precise timekeeping and control.

Features:
Nixie Tube Display: The clock features a set of Nixie tubes, providing a unique and retro way to showcase the current time.

Atmega32A Processor: Powered by the Atmega32A microcontroller, the clock ensures accurate timekeeping and efficient processing.

Real-Time Clock (RTC): The clock incorporates a real-time clock module to maintain accurate time, even when powered off.

DCF77 Time Synchronization: Enjoy the added convenience of automatic time synchronization through the DCF77 feature, allowing the clock to receive signals directly from the German lab every night at 1 am.

Hardware:
Atmega32A Microcontroller: The heart of the project, responsible for processing and controlling the Nixie tube display.

Nixie Tubes: Vintage Nixie tubes are used to display hours, minutes, and seconds.

Real-Time Clock Module: An external RTC module ensures accurate timekeeping and eliminates the need for manual adjustments.

DCF77 Receiver: The clock is equipped with a DCF77 receiver to receive time signals directly from the German lab, ensuring precise time synchronization.

User Interface Components: Buttons or rotary encoders for user input, making it easy to set the time.
